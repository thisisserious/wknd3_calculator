# Weekend Challenge \#3, Calculator App
This assignment is a calculator app that allows me to practice setting up a server, client, and router(s).

For the basic mode, input fields accept 2 numbers, radio buttons are used to select the math operation - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division - and a button is used for the final calculation/equals sign. The answer will then appear on the DOM below the input fields along with a 'clear' button.

## To Do
- Style using Bootstrap
